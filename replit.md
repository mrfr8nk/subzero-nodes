## User Preferences
- Non-technical language preferred
- Focus on functional improvements over technical details
- Real-time feedback and visual indicators important
- Terminal-style interfaces preferred for deployment logs

## Architecture Changes

### Backend Enhancements
- **Enhanced Monitoring System**: Added `getWorkflowRunLogs()` and `detectAppStartInLogs()` functions
- **Retry Logic**: Implemented robust retry mechanisms for GitHub API calls
