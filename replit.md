# SUBZERO Deployment Platform

## Project Overview
A comprehensive deployment platform that enables users to deploy and manage applications through GitHub Actions with real-time monitoring, advanced logging, and automated status tracking.

## Recent Changes (August 14, 2025)

### Critical Deployment System Fixes Completed
✅ **GitHub Settings Database Integration**
- Fixed critical bug where GitHub settings weren't being saved to database
- Configured proper app_settings table with user's repository (takudzwa07/B)
- Integrated real GitHub Personal Access Token from environment variables
- Resolved "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')" JavaScript error

✅ **Enhanced GitHub Integration**
- Fixed "failed to get branch" errors with retry logic (3 attempts with delays)
- Added advanced waiting and status tracking for GitHub workflow creation
- Implemented proper error handling for branch creation and workflow triggering
- Dynamic repository configuration now working with user's actual GitHub repo

✅ **Real-time Log Streaming** 
- Created advanced log monitoring system that fetches live GitHub Actions logs
- Added automatic app status detection (monitors for npm start, node index.js, etc.)
- Deployment status automatically changes to "active" when app start is detected
- Implemented WebSocket broadcasting for real-time updates

✅ **Enhanced Terminal Display**
- Professional terminal-style log viewer with macOS-style window controls
- Color-coded log lines (errors in red, warnings in yellow, success in green, etc.)
- Real-time log streaming with auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- Improved terminal formatting with proper spacing and readability

✅ **Environment Variable Management**
- Fixed config.js and settings.js updates to properly sync with environment variables
- When editing deployment variables, both config.js and settings.js are updated
- Auto-generation of environment variables in config files
- Proper handling of missing config files (creates them if needed)

✅ **Advanced Workflow Monitoring**
- Monitors GitHub Actions workflows with 8-second initialization delay
- Tracks installation progress (npm install), package.json processing
- Detects when applications become active and updates status automatically
- WebSocket notifications for workflow completion and status changes

✅ **JavaScript Error Resolution**
- Fixed deployment details page TypeError with proper null safety checks
- Enhanced error handling for missing deployment data
- Improved fallback values for deployment names and properties

## User Preferences
- Non-technical language preferred
- Focus on functional improvements over technical details
- Real-time feedback and visual indicators important
- Terminal-style interfaces preferred for deployment logs

## Architecture Changes

### Backend Enhancements
- **Enhanced Monitoring System**: Added `getWorkflowRunLogs()` and `detectAppStartInLogs()` functions
- **Retry Logic**: Implemented robust retry mechanisms for GitHub API calls
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket broadcasting system for live deployment status
- **Storage Extensions**: Added `getDeploymentByBranchName()` function for deployment lookups

### Frontend Improvements  
- **Terminal Component**: Professional terminal-style log viewer with color coding
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Auto-refresh deployment logs every 10 seconds
- **Status Detection**: Visual indicators for running, completed, and failed deployments
- **Enhanced UX**: Improved loading states and error handling

### Key Technical Features
1. **GitHub Branch Management**: Automatic branch creation with conflict resolution
2. **Configuration Sync**: Bidirectional sync between deployment variables and config files
3. **Status Automation**: Auto-detection of app startup and status updates
4. **Log Processing**: Advanced log parsing with syntax highlighting
5. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Next Steps
- Monitor deployment success rates and optimize retry logic
- Add deployment analytics and performance tracking
- Implement deployment rollback functionality
- Enhance real-time collaboration features

## Technical Notes
- All GitHub API calls now include retry logic with exponential backoff
- WebSocket connections automatically handle deployment monitoring
- Terminal log display supports full ANSI color code processing
- Environment variables are synchronized across all configuration files
